# Cryptography

## Overview

---

### **Crypto core**

* Secret ket establishment
  
* Secure communication
  * confidentially
  * integrity
  
* Digital signaturez
  
* Anonymous communication
  
* Anonymous **digital** cash
  * Can I spend a **digital coin** without anyone knowing who I am?
  * How to prevent double spending?

* Secure multi-party computation
  * “Thm:”   anything that can done with trusted authority can also be done withouttrustedauthority

* Privately outsourcing computation
  * Get search result from Google while Google doesn't know what you search for

* Zero knoledge
  * one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, **without conveying any information** apart from the fact that they know the value x

### **Three steps in cryptography**

1. Precesely specify threat model
    * What an attacker can do
    * What an attacker's goal is

2. Propose a construction

3. Prove that breaking construction under threat mode will solve an underlying hard problem

## History

---

* Symmetric Ciphers
  * Both the encrypter and decrypter use the same key
